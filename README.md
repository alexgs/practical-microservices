# Practical Microservices

This repository contains implementation(s) of the architecture and patterns described in [_Practical Microservices: Build Event-Driven Architectures with Event Sourcing and CQRS_][1] by Ethan Garofolo (Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2020). The code in this repository is an original expression of the ideas in this book.

## Status

- **2022-06-22:** I ran into trouble getting the subscription `start` method to run for the homepage query. I like Garofolo's overall pattern and approach, but his stack is somewhat idiosyncratic. It may be easier for me to implement event sourcing and CQRS with Express and MongoDB, or in Nest.js. I am going to explore those alternatives for now. The _WIN-19_ branches represent my current work-in-progress.

## Personal note, April 2021

Why yes, I have been watching _Game of Thrones_ recently. I know I'm late to this party, but I played D&D in the 1980s&mdash;I was into dragons and castles long before they were cool.
