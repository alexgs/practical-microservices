# Starting a greenfield project

Here I'm going to keep track of all the things I do to set this project up. Fascinating, I know.

1. Copy `docker-compose.yml` from a previous project and adapt for this one.
1. Copy top-level dot-files from previous projects.
1. Copy task-files from previous projects and adapt for this one.
1. Create `.env` file and set values.
1. **Commit** without having run anything.
